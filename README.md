# ModTheHat
ModTheHat: Modloader for King of the Hat

## How it works

We use a tried and proven technique that other modloaders for Unity games use. Which is by using [MonoMod](https://github.com/MonoMod/MonoMod/blob/master/README.md).

## How to compile:

First step is to update the libs folder. This folder is required to compile our custom Assembly-CSsharp

Copy the libraries from the 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\King of the Hat\KingOfTheHat_Data\Managed' folder into seesharp/libs
